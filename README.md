## Description

Welcome to my rocket playground, where rockets are subject for rapid unscheduled disassembly due to various reasons. But sometimes, they land autonomously, hover, reach low and high orbits, fly in circles and do other cool stuff.

I'm trying to keep the game realistic. Expect some math here.


## Scripts
- [x] landing.py - launches the rocket to the specified altitude and performs the suicide burn
- [ ] hover-demo.py - just a proof of concept that it's possible to hover with kRPC


## [kRPC](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/)
kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from scripts running outside of the game. It comes with client libraries for many popular languages including C#, C++, Java, Lua and Python. Clients, made by others, are also available for Ruby and Haskell.
It has good [documentation](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/index.html) and it's pretty easy to use.


## KSP
Kerbal Space Program is a space flight simulation video game developed and published by Squad. The game features a realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital maneuvers.

I'm using KSP 1.7.2. Mods kinda work with it, yet sometimes I get crashes with my setup, so beware.

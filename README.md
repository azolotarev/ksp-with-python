##Description
Welcome to my rocket playground, where rockets are subject for rapid unscheduled disassembly due to various reasons. But sometimes, they land autonomously, hover, reach low and high orbits, fly in circles and do other cool stuff.
I'm trying to keep the game realistic enough, but I'm not too obsessed with realism. KSP is just a game/simulator and not a sophisticated physics engine for supercomputers. If there's an easy way to improve the KSP's physics (i.e. with mods), I'm all for it, but don't expect heavy maths here.


##Scripts - checklist
+hover-demo.py - just a proof of concept that it's possible to hover with kRPC
+10k-and-land.py - launches the rocket to the specified altitude and performs the suicide burn
-to LEO and land - Falcon 9 style mission to Low Earth Orbit. 1st stage returns back to the launch complex and 2nd stage delivers the payload.
-to GEO and land at the barge


##[kRPC](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/)
kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from scripts running outside of the game. It comes with client libraries for many popular languages including C#, C++, Java, Lua and Python. Clients, made by others, are also available for Ruby and Haskell.
It has good [documentation](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/index.html) and it's pretty easy to use.


##KSP
Kerbal Space Program is a space flight simulation video game developed and published by Squad. The game features a realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital maneuvers.



##Mods
